This repo contains the Loan Risk Prediction project as part of our SE project made under the guidance of Mr. Santosh Singh Rathore. Evaluation metric which is the accuracy i.e. percentage of loan approval that is correctly predicted. 
This project covers the whole process from problem statement to model development and evaluation:

2.	Hypothesis Generation
3.	Data Collection
4.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5.	Data Pre-processing

Problem Statement
Business Problem : 
Loan prediction is a very common real-life problem that every retail bank faces in their lending operations. If the loan approval process is automated, it can save a lot of man hours and improve the speed of service to the customers. The increase in customer satisfaction and savings in operational costs are significant. However, the benefits can only be reaped if the bank has a robust model to accurately predict which customer's loan it should approve and which to reject, in order to minimize the risk of loan default.
Translate Business Problem into Data Science / Machine Learning problem
This is a classification problem where we have to predict whether a loan will be approved or not. Specifically, it is a binary classification problem where we have to predict either one of the two classes given i.e. approved (Y) or not approved (N). Another way to frame the problem is to predict whether the loan will likely to default or not, if it is likely to default, then the loan would not be approved, and vice versa. The dependent variable or target variable is the Loan_Status, while the rest are independent variable or features. We need to develop a model using the features to predict the target variable.
